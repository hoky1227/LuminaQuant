# Session Handoff: Portfolio Optimizer Integration Cleanup (2026-05-08)

## Baseline
- Branch: `private-main`
- Preserved green SHA: `e4b63bf80e368af80c8e09404c6d2a4089d8b956`
- GitHub Actions baseline: `private-ci 25501812630` success and `ci 25501812724` success.
- Source plan: `.omx/plans/ralplan-portfolio-optimizer-integration-cleanup-20260507.md`
- Context snapshot: `.omx/context/portfolio-optimizer-integration-cleanup-20260508T094016Z.md`

## Team / Ralph status
- `$team` was invoked through `omx team 4:executor` as `luminaquant-portfolio-0d950126`.
- Runtime evidence: four worker panes started, then stopped before task claim; shutdown was forced with `merge_outcome: noop` and no worker diffs.
- Continued through Ralph single-owner fallback; state was persisted under `.omx/state/ralph-state.json`.

## Implemented
1. Inserted bounded repo tree/ownership map into `AGENTS.md` before source edits using `<!-- LQ:TREE:START -->` / `<!-- LQ:TREE:END -->`.
2. Added `src/lumina_quant/portfolio/optimizer_core.py` for shared stream normalization/alignment, metrics, correlation, `StreamCache`, and objective-policy payload labels.
3a. Added `src/lumina_quant/portfolio/hybrid_objective.py` so hybrid-governor scoring stays outside the generic stream/allocation core.
3. Refactored `scripts/run_portfolio_optimization.py` to reuse shared core and reuse one `StreamCache` across clustering, fit returns, and report streams while preserving the outer memory guard.
4. Unified safe-float usage in moonshot tuning / calendar Optuna scripts.
5. Added locked-OOS objective policy metadata to generic optimizer output.
6. Updated hybrid curated tuning and hybrid Optuna tuning to default to `locked_train_val`; OOS-scored profiles remain explicit diagnostics and are labeled not selection-authoritative.
7. Added regression tests for split aliasing, stream aggregation, locked-OOS policy, hybrid tuning/Optuna objective behavior, and generic optimizer report labels.

## Performance evidence
- Artifact: `.omx/plans/portfolio_optimizer_perf_20260508.{json,md}`
- Synthetic stream hot path: uncached `17.079857766000032s`, cached `1.7218335879999813s`, speedup `9.919575204616242x`.
- Peak RSS `109727744` bytes, under the 8 GiB guard.

## Verification evidence before final commit
- `uv run --extra dev pytest -q tests/test_portfolio_optimizer_core.py` → `3 passed`.
- `uv run --extra dev pytest -q tests/test_portfolio_optimizer_core.py tests/test_run_portfolio_optimization_script.py tests/test_profit_moonshot_fresh_portfolio_tuning.py tests/test_optuna_tune_profit_moonshot_calendar.py tests/test_profit_moonshot_pass_under_8gb_validator.py` → `17 passed`.
- Post-deslop final targeted suite → `17 passed in 2.66s`.
- Focused final gates: `ruff check` on touched optimizer/tuning/validator/core/tests → passed; `py_compile` on touched scripts/core → passed; `git diff --check` → passed.
- Full local suite: `uv run --extra dev pytest -q` → `1188 passed, 1262 warnings in 346.81s`.

## Remaining finish gates for any reboot
1. Squash/local Lore commit if desired so `private/main` advances cleanly from `e4b63bf...`.
2. Push `HEAD:main` to remote `private`.
3. Wait for GitHub Actions `ci` and `private-ci` to pass for the pushed SHA.

- Architect re-check after splitting `hybrid_objective.py`: `CLEAR`; no architectural blockers.
- Post-split full local suite: `uv run --extra dev pytest -q` → `1188 passed, 1262 warnings in 369.57s`.
